# CIT 470, Systems Security II
## Above-and-beyond 2
### Task
Complete an optional project that creatively goes "above and beyond" the tasks you and your partner(s) are working on in your team projects.

Students that achieve a passing grade with each of their team tasks and peer evaluations will pass the course with a C grade. Above-and-beyond tasks are projects that students may accomplish individually. There are eight Above-and-beyond opportunities in this course.

### Tools
One one or more of your team's virtual machines, install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), a software utility for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- Wireshark features a Graphical User Interface application, useful for interactive packet-captures and packet-analysis.
It also includes a terminal-based command-line utility, [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolstshark.html),
which complements Wireshark; for some tasks it is more practical than the GUI application.
- Most Linux distributions' default installations provide the command-line utility [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/).
Learn to use this tool too; you'll likely use it often in your future careers.
