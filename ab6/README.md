## Task: IDS Sensor
- Configure a alternative NIDS sensor, managed from your secure zone, that monitors DMZ network traffic, and alerts when it notices potentially malicious traffic.

## Tools
- NIDS sensor software (different from the one you used for M04 Task: IDS Sensor)

## Requirements
- NIDS sensor monitors all DMZ network traffic
- NIDS alerts on any potentially malicious traffic
- NIDS does not alert on normal network traffic

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what your team did and how you accomplished it.

- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- Identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- Include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate. Also upload your updated and annotated network diagram.

## Scoring Rubric
- If your tutorial satisfies every requirement outlined above, you will earn a passing score (one point).
- If your tutorial does not satisfy any one of the above requirements, you will earn no points. Your team must then address any deficiencies and re-upload corrected documents until you earn the passing score.
