## Task: Above-and-Beyond 8

## Tools
- Varies based on project

## Requirements
- Select an Above-and-Beyond project from the list of possible Above-and-Beyond projects in M00: Semester Project Tasks and Requirements, or come up with your own.
- Come up with a list of requirements for the project and message your instructor for project and requirements approval

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what your team did and how you accomplished it.
- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- Identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- Include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate. Also upload your updated and annotated network diagram.

## Scoring Rubric
- If your tutorial satisfies every requirement outlined above, you will earn a passing score (one point).
- If your tutorial does not satisfy any one of the above requirements, you will earn no points. Your team must then address any deficiencies and re-upload corrected documents until you earn the passing score.

## Hints
- Don't spend too much time getting the perfect list of requirements. It's better and faster to get a good list of requirements and then get your instructor feedback on your list.
