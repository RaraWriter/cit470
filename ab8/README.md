## Task: Above-and-Beyond 8

## Tools
- Same as those revealed in the [Penetration Testing Exercise](cit470/pentest).

## Requirements
- After you and your team have succeeded in accomplishing one of the objectives that satisfies the Penetration Testing Exercise,
you may continue working, either individually or with other classmates, to accomplish any of the other Penetration Testing Exercise objectives.
- Produce another illustrated tutorial that shows how you achieved your additional objective.
(If you worked together with other classmates on this above-and-beyond task, each of you must write your own report.)

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what you did and how you accomplished it.
- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- Identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- Include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate.

## Scoring Rubric
- If your tutorial satisfies every requirement outlined above, you will earn a passing score (one point).
- If your tutorial does not satisfy any one of the above requirements, you will earn no points. Your team must then address any deficiencies and re-upload corrected documents until you earn the passing score.

## Hints
- Complete your first objective in the Penetration Testing Exercise *before* you "go above and beyond" to tackle another objective.
- The same hints, for the [Penetration Testing Exercise](cit470/pentest) team task, also apply to this individual above-and-beyond task.
