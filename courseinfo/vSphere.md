# CIT 470, Systems Security II
## Tool: CIT department VMware infrastructure

Students enrolled in selected courses
manage virtual machines in a VMware infrastructure operated by the CIT department at BYU-Idaho.
Our VMware infrastructure integrates VMware's ESXi hypervisor software, vCenter server software, and vSphere management software
on clusters of enterprise-grade server hardware.

As a CIT 470 student, you will use vSphere to create and operate virtual servers.
