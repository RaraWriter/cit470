## Task: Above-and-beyond 3
Deploy an authoritative DNS server that resolves "localdomain" hostnames, and also deploy a DHCP server able to assign sticky leased addresses to your teams' endpoint hosts, along with DHCP proxy ("helper") functionality on a firewall to extend that service across security zones.

## Tools
[CIT department VMware infrastructure](/cit470/courseinfo/vSphere)

## Requirements
Make certain that you have met the following requirements:
- All "localdomain" hostnames are resolved with the correct IP addresses.
- Sticky leased IP addresses are correctly assigned to your endpoint hosts.
- DNS functionality extends across security zones.

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what your team did and how you accomplished it.
- your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate.
