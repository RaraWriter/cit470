## Task: Peer Evaluation
Assess your working relationship with your teammate(s) and provide explanations and supporting evidence for your assessments.

You will write a peer evaluation status report three times during the course (approximately once per month).

## Instructions
Your peer evaluation assignment is delivered as a "Graded Quiz" in I-Learn Canvas.
The "quiz" consists of the following three essay questions,
not necessarily presented in this order:

> ***Learn from others' examples*** <br/>
Question:
What have you observed your teammate(s) doing to build trust with you?
Provide details and evidence of your assessment.

> ***Reflect on your own "soft skills"*** <br/>
Question:
What have you done to build trust with your teammate(s)?
Provide details and evidence of your assessment.

> ***Consider your team's welfare*** <br/>
Question:
How are you and your teammate(s) negotiating tasks, goals, and division of labor with each other?
Are you happy with this process? Explain.

## Requirements
Your instructor will read and score your 'graded quiz' peer evaluation.

To earn full credit:
- provide a brief answer to each question;
- make your answer thoughtful, respectful, and meaningful;
- offer *evidence* to support your answer.

> (If an answer is: <br /><ul><li>long and rambling, or</li><li>frivolous, disrespectful, or light-minded, or</li><li>without written evidence to back up your assessment</li></ul> then your instructor may only award fractions of points, rather than full credit.)
