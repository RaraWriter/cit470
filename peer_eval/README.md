## Task: Peer Evaluation
Assess your working relationship with your teammate(s) and provide explanations and supporting evidence for your assessments.

You will write a peer evaluation status report three times during the course (approximately once per month).

## Instructions
Your peer evaluation assignment is delivered as a "Graded Quiz" in I-Learn.
The "quiz" consists of the following three essay questions,
not necessarily presented in this order:

> **Learn from others' examples** <br/>
Question:
What have you observed your teammate(s) doing to build trust with you?
Provide details and evidence of your assessment.

> **Reflect on your own "soft skills"** <br/>
Question:
What have you done to build trust with your teammate(s)?
Provide details and evidence of your assessment.

> **Consider your team's welfare** <br/>
Question:
How are you and your teammate(s) negotiating tasks, goals, and division of labor with each other?
Are you happy with this process? Explain.

## Requirements
Your instructor will read and score your 'graded quiz' peer evaluation.

To earn full credit:
- Provide a brief answer to each question.
- Make your answer thoughtful, respectful, and meaningful.
- Offer evidence to support your answer.

If an answer meets any of this criteria, then your instructor may only award fractions of points, rather than full credit:
- Long and rambling
- Frivolous, disrespectful, or light-minded
- Without written evidence to back up your assessment
