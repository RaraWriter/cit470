# CIT 470, Systems Security II
## Tiered App
### Task
Work with your team to deploy *Question2Answer* as a three-tiered web app, with a protected database *back-end* in your **secure** zone, users web browser *clients* in the **outside** zone, and the web server *middleware* in your **dmz**. Then clone your web server, so that you have two middleware servers, and deploy a load balancer in the **dmz** to leverage both web servers. This will scale up your web app's performance, and the web server redundancy will also increase your app's availability.

### Tools
- Use either [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as the back-end database. Very likely,
this will be easy to install using your Linux distribution's package manager.
- Use either [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [nginx](https://nginx.org/) as your web server. Very likely,
this will be easy to install using your Linux distirbution's package manager.
- Download the latest version of [Question2Answer](https://www.question2answer.org/) to your **dmz** web server.

### Requirements
Phase I:
- Find and read the Question2Answer installation instructions.
