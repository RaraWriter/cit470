## Task: Penetration Testing Exercise

## Tools
- A [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) Virtual Machine in your team's DMZ.

## Requirements
- Before you receive this task's requirements and hints,
your instructor will ask you to agree to a [non-disclosure agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement), or *(NDA)*.
- After every student has agreed to the terms of the NDA,
your instructor will reveal the penetration testing engagement scenario's (PTES) requirements and hints.
  - *(The purpose of the NDA is to deter everyone from revealing details about the PTES to future students.)*
- For this assignment, only one team member needs to submit the report document on behalf of the entire team.
  - For this assignment, you are also welcome to collaborate with every student in the entire class, not just with your team partner(s).
- When the requirements are revealed, you will notice multiple objectives in the penetration testing exercise.
Your team only needs to accomplish one of the objective to complete this task.
(After that, you are welcome to work on one of the other objectives as an [individual above-and-beyond](cit470/ab8) task.)

## Deliverable
Upload an illustrated tutorial, in which you explain what your team did and how you accomplished it.
- Your document should be clear enough that one of your peers would be able to follow your instructions and accomplish the same tasks.
- Identify any difficult or challenging parts of the project, and clearly explain how you diagnosed and overcame your obstacles.
- Include a few cropped screen captures where appropriate. Also upload your updated and annotated network diagram.

## Scoring Rubric
- If your tutorial satisfies every requirement outlined above, you will earn a passing score (one point).
- If your tutorial does not satisfy any one of the above requirements, you will earn no points. Your team must then address any deficiencies and re-upload corrected documents until you earn the passing score.

## Hints
